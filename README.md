INTRODUCTION

React Store Project Is For The Begginer.This project is component based.Static data from "react-city-project/src/components/tourData.js" File is render in the landing page.All The images which are render in the landing page are in "react-city-project/public/img/"location.Navbar,Tour and Tourlist are three main components.For styling bootstrap and scss style sheet are used. Well For a begginer it is very much important to know how to handel the state in the application,apart from this how to re-use the components.I think this project gives a good demonstration to all of the above.No network call are made for fetching data.Data are fetch from a file tourData.js.then the fetch data is store in the state("react-city-project/src/components/TourList/index.js/").State manipulation is done with the click of Remove button which get appear on mouse hover.Filter funtion is used to remove the item from the array.then that modified array set in the state.
